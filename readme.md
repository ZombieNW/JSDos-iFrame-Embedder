# Embed JSDos Emu

An easily embeddable url-query based page for the JSDos Emulator.

![Language](https://badgen.net/badge/language/HTML&CSS&JS/red)

## why?
JSDos is great but setting up to just put a simple swf on your web page can be slightly annoying.
So, I've made the whole process as easy as making an iframe.

## setup
Using this is as easy as just making an iframe with your swf in it!

### working example
```html
  <iframe width="800px" height="600px" src="https://dosemu.zombienw.com/?swf=https://cdn.dos.zone/custom/dos/doom.jsdos" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
